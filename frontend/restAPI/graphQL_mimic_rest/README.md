# same setting as  ../graphQL/src
# do not use any new lib for fair testing
# this repo is subject to merge under graphQL, but for readability and reference while
# building REST, remains as it is.

# to replicate package to customized work dir, fist run:
# npm init -y  


npm install

# for later 
# npm ci
