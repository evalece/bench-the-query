I cheked tools like the following but decides to do low level logging and tracking to stay primtive and transparent.
In addition, we are only looking at API client efficiency in various query length and throughtput with specific protocols... 
FastAPI with Grafana
https://dev.to/ken_mwaura1/getting-started-monitoring-a-fastapi-app-with-grafana-and-prometheus-a-step-by-step-guide-3fbn 


API request <-> API server (port yyy) <--- (potential propogation delay) ---> (port xxx) Redis DB

We track:

1. query_id

2. client_sent_time

3. server_received_time

4. server_duration

5. redis_duration

6. client_received_time

7. round_trip_time (Propogation delay)
