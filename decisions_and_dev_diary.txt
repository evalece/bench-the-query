I cheked tools like the following but decides to do low level logging and tracking to stay primtive and transparent.
In addition, we are only looking at API client efficiency in various query length and throughtput with specific protocols... 
FastAPI with Grafana
https://dev.to/ken_mwaura1/getting-started-monitoring-a-fastapi-app-with-grafana-and-prometheus-a-step-by-step-guide-3fbn 


API request <-> API server (port yyy) <--- (potential propogation delay) ---> (port xxx) Redis DB

We track:

1. query_id

2. client_sent_time

3. server_received_time

4. server_duration

5. redis_duration

6. client_received_time

7. round_trip_time (Propogation delay)

Originally planned to complete this project by  April 14ish, but decided to allocate more time to 
deliver a smarter script that generates and implements 
1. client code in GraphQL and REST API accross all benchmark 
2. automates (optional) data importation to Redis with Lua and is customizable 
3. (side note for 2.) I'm doing flat datasets for now, no subquery, but will do later 


Next up:
1. Reading: 
- Concurrency & CPU related topics reading- currently all using asynch non-blocking but need to look into concurrent reques and spike.
- Present hardware health with latency and other findings (knowing these causes unfairness).
2. More Writing:
-Explain potentail unfairness and metigations in my baseline GraphQL REST- mimicing model
