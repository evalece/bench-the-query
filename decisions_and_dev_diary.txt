I cheked tools like the following but decides to do low level logging and tracking to stay primtive and transparent.
In addition, we are only looking at API client efficiency in various query length and throughtput with specific protocols... 
FastAPI with Grafana
https://dev.to/ken_mwaura1/getting-started-monitoring-a-fastapi-app-with-grafana-and-prometheus-a-step-by-step-guide-3fbn 


API request <-> API server (port yyy) <--- (potential propogation delay) ---> (port xxx) Redis DB

We track:

1. query_id

2. client_sent_time

3. server_received_time

4. server_duration

5. redis_duration

6. client_received_time

7. round_trip_time (Propogation delay)

Originally planned to complete this project by  April 14ish, but decided to allocate more time to 
deliver a smarter script that generates and implements 
1. client code in GraphQL and REST API accross all benchmark 
2. automates (optional) data importation to Redis with Lua and is customizable 
3. (side note for 2.) I'm doing flat datasets for now, no subquery, but will do later 


Next up:
1. Reading: 
- Concurrency & CPU related topics reading- currently all using asynch non-blocking but need to look into concurrent reques and spike.
- Present hardware health with latency and other findings (knowing these causes unfairness).
2. More Writing:
-Explain potentail unfairness and metigations in my baseline GraphQL REST- mimicing model

1. Load test using k6
- allow users to import text files to specify scheduled load (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mtYVDA2_iQ)
- Pack k6 as part of the image for all-in-one -> reduce build time 

2. K6 and I/O with potential bias
Use a 2-phase test pattern (warmup â†’ benchmark)

Phase 1: Run a short warm-up or data capture phase (with I/O)
Phase 2: Run your actual measurement test (with logging minimized)


GraphQL:
Use their dataloader in benchmark, but also add a Naive one that has nothing while doing nested query.
-Nested Queries: 
1. Use independent .js for import
2. Allow users to import cusomized schema and resolvers 
This way the project scope is managable 


April 20 

1. REST API can do multi-query, too, iff API endpoint is defined. 
Users are said to request exactly want they wanted in graphQL but not in REST.
REST does this by filtering API endpoint query fields to reduce unnessary queries. 

2. Take a closer look at romise.all() or asyncio.gather() for GraphQL ****

3.Learning today: Dynamic API endpoint in REST API (i.e./endpoint/query fields 1... n) allows users 
to query exactly what is wanted. Similiar to GraphQL but with extra pagination + less handler complexity


April 22 

1. containerize +pass command via script + or, docker image if bootstraps logic complex


April 24
FastAPI <-> Redis OK (Containerized)

April 25

1. Redis + K6 containerized 
2. Images of Redis + FastAPI + GraphQL + K6 in one Docker compose
